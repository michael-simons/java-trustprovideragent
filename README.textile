h1. SSL trust provider for development and tests

This is a java.security.Provider that trusts all hosts and accepts all certificates. It is not meant to be used in production. 

Most part of the code is based on this "post":http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/joe/archive/2005/07/06/1345.aspx on f5.com with 2 additions:

# I added a custom HostnameVerifier, to accept certificates with wrong hostnames
# I wrapped everything with an agent

I didn't want to modify my source codes or fiddle with security configuration files.

To use this agent use download the code, use maven to compile and run your program with the addition vm option "-javaagent:full/path/to/java-trustprovideragent-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"

That's it.
